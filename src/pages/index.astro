        >The goal of the CAD sub-team is to create digital models of our robots
        and other important components. We use these designs to create
        prototypes of our ideas. Occasionally, we 3D print or laser cut our
        CADed components for use on our robot. Eventually, we would like to use
        our CAD models to manufacture parts using more advanced methods like CNC
        milling.

      <span slot="description"
        >The mechanical sub-team builds the robot using the models that our CAD
        team made. Due to the small nature of our team, there is a large overlap
        between the mechanical and CAD sub-teams. Typically, a majority of our
        robot is built manually with hand tools. There is a plus side - students
        learn hands-on skills. However, methods like CNC milling are far more
        accurate and take far less time.

        robot. Sadly, it is often the smallest team as many students think they
        could never code. We would like to change that perception.</span
